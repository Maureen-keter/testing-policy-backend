# Insurance Policy Management System - Backend

This is the backend for the **Insurance Policy Management System**, designed to handle API requests, database operations, and business logic for managing insurance policies. The backend is built with **Python** and **Flask**, with data persistence handled via **SQLite** (or your chosen database).

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for insurance policies.
- Basic search and filter functionality.
- RESTful API design for seamless integration with the frontend.

## Tech Stack

- **Flask**: python runtime for the server-side.
- **SQLite**: Database for data persistence.
